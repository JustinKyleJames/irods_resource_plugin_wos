iRODS WOS Resource Plugin
-------------------------

To build the WOS Resource Plugin, you will need to have:

 - the iRODS Development Tools (irods-dev) installed for your platform
     http://irods.org/download
 - libcurl

Then to build this resource plugin:

  ./packaging/build.sh


To use this resource plugin:

  irods@hostname $ iadmin mkresc archiveResc wos <hostname>:/fakeVaultPath "wos_host=<WOSEndpoint>;wos_policy=<PolicyName>"


Leveraging WOS replication with iRODS:

The DDN WOS appliance has the ability to create policies which allow for the repilcation of data objects between appliances.
When this feature is used iRODS will not be aware of an exisiting replica which may be locally resident.  In order for iRODS
be made aware of the possiblity of these repilcas, an additional configuration parameter has been added to the WOS resource plugin.
This option will instruct the plugin to stat a given OID, and should it exist locally, register that OID as a new replica within iRODS.

In order for this feature to be immediately useful the Compound resource need to have its policy set to "prefer archive" and all WOS
appliances in the Zone must be grouped under a Deferred node.

Configuration:

1. Set the cache refresh policy for compound resources by uncommenting this line in /etc/irods/core.re
   pep_resource_resolve_hierarchy_pre(*OUT){*OUT="compound_resource_cache_refresh_policy=always";}
   
2. Enable the check for replicas within the wos plugin by adding "repl_policy=on" to the WOS context string

3. Every compound resource servicing a WOS node in the WOS cluster must be grouped under a Deferred node. This allows for the locally
   resident WOS replica to win the vote for hierarchy resolution given that a Deferred node simply picks the highest vote.
